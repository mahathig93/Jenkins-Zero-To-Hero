:::::::::::::::::::shell commands::::::::::::::::::::::

1. If any shell command is executed from Jenkins script -> Stage -> steps:
   Need to remember that scope is limited to that step alone. (i.e whatever cd kind-off cmds executed will get reset by Jenkins when execution goes to next execution statement)
2. To run multiple shell commands at ones, following syntax have to be followed:

                            sh '''
                            echo "Now in directory:"
                            cd stage1
							pwd
                            ls -la
                            make test
                            ls -la 
                            echo "Building done"
                            '''

:::::::::::::::::::::WebHook::::::::::::::::::::
0. Purpose of this: On commit trigger of Jenkins Job.

1. Webhook expects, Jenkins url to be reachable as it does internally ping to the Jenkins service. 
   So, when configuring the GITHUB with webhook we need to ensure Jenkins url is pingable from internet (or) we need to 
   expose the jenkins url to public domain.
2. Utility used to the exposing the local jenkings url to public is done through "ngrok"
3. "ngrok": Need to signup for this, follow the  install steps given in the website. 
    CMD: ngrok http url:8080 
4. On the GITHUB, Navigation for configuring the webhook:
   Settings -> WebHook -> Add Webhook -> Payload Url:
     <Jenkinsurl>/github-webhook/

   Verify: Goback to Settings -> Webhook -> We need to see Tick Mark comming on the WebHOok added. 
           If not: Ensure, Jenkins url is accessible from internet.
                   Encourage Deleting the existing WebHook and Adding NewOne instead of editing.		   
	 
5. Navigation On Jenkins:
   Goto Pipline -> configure -> General Settings -> 
   Check Mark Web Hook related option.
